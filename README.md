<h1> Recovering JPEGs from a forensic image</h1>

<p>
My solution to CS50's problem set 4 - Recover. The programm iterates over a memory card, looking for JPEGs' signatures.
For each new signature a new file is being created and filled with the bytes from the memory card leading to the recovery of all JPEG files.
